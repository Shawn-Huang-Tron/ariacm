<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>1.    About this Website: </strong></p>
<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;">The information on this Website is issued and communicated by ARIA Capital Management (Europe) (“ACME,” “we” and “us”), which is authorised and regulated by the Maltese Financial Services Authority (“MFSA”). This Website contains information about various umbrella funds (each an “Umbrella Fund” and together the “Umbrella Funds”) and their sub-funds (the “Funds”) which have been registered, or otherwise notified, for public distribution and marketing in the jurisdiction you hav.<br><br>

Please note that the fact of such registration or notification does not mean that any regulator including the Maltese Financial Services Authority, (or the Central Bank of Ireland or any national regulator of your jurisdiction) has determined that the Funds are suitable for all or any investors.<br><br> 

The Funds referred to on this Website may not be suitable investments for you and you should therefore seek professional investment advice before making a decision to invest in any of the Funds.</p><br>

<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>2.    Access to this Website: </strong></p>
<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;">In order to access this Website, you have been asked to select the jurisdiction which is applicable for the intended investment activities. Your selection will be used to determine the information that you will be able to access on this Website. You hereby represent and warrant to ACME that the information that you have provided is true, accurate and complete and you undertake to notify us of any change to such information. Failure to provide us with accurate information will be treated as a material breach of these Terms. Certain Funds may not be available in all geographical locations and so information about certain Funds may not be available to all users of this Website. You must not attempt to gain access to areas of this Website other than those made available to users in the jurisdiction you selected. If the jurisdiction you should select changes, you must access this Website selecting your new jurisdiction. You should be aware that this may result in you not being able to access (i) information in relation to the same Funds as previously, or (ii) any information at all. Please note that the fact of selecting a jurisdiction does not mean that all or any of the Funds in relation to which information is made available, have been deemed suitable for you.<br><br>

When using this Website you must comply with all applicable local, national and international laws and regulations including those related to data privacy, international communications and exportation of technical or personal data. It may be unlawful to access or download the information contained on this Website in certain countries and the Umbrella Funds, ACME and its affiliates disclaim all responsibility if you access or download any information from this Website in breach of any law or regulation of the United Kingdom, the jurisdiction in which you are residing or domiciled or the jurisdiction from which you access the Website. <br><br>

If you are acting as a financial adviser or intermediary, you agree to access this Website only for the purposes for which you are permitted to do so under applicable law. If you are acting as a financial adviser or intermediary and provide services to clients categorised as retail clients under MiFID, you agree that you will not share with or provide to your retail clients any information available on this Website that has not been approved for retail use and is not otherwise suitable for your retail clients. <br><br>

ACME reserves the right to suspend or withdraw access to any page(s) included on this Website without notice at any time and accepts no liability if, for any reason, these pages are unavailable at any time or for any period.</p><br>

<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>3.    No Market Timing: </strong></p>
<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;">You agree not to engage in any “market timing” practices with respect to your investment in any Fund and shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that no user authorised to access this Website on your behalf engages in any such market timing practices. For these purposes, “market timing” shall include engaging in any trading strategy with the intention of taking advantage of short term changes in market prices including (without limitation) by engaging in: (i) excessive trading, (ii) late trading or (iii) market abuse.</p><br>


<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>4.    U.S. Persons: </strong></p>
<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;">Interests in the Funds are not being offered, and will not be sold, within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, any U.S. Person. The term U.S. Person shall have the meaning given to it in Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and includes, among other things, U.S. residents and U.S. corporations and partnerships.</p><br>

<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>5.    Selling Restrictions: </strong></p>
<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;">The distribution of the information and documentation on this Website may be restricted by law in certain countries. This Website, and the information and documentation on it, are not addressed to any person resident in the territory of any jurisdiction where such distribution would be contrary to local law or regulation. Not all the Funds in relation to which information is available on this Website are available in all geographical locations and so not all areas of this Website will be accessible to all users. The Funds are not available, and offering materials relating to them will not be distributed, to any person resident in any jurisdiction where such distribution would be contrary to local law or regulation.</p><br>

<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>6.    No Investment Advice: </strong></p>
<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;">The information on this Website is provided for information only and on the basis that you will make your own investment decisions. <br><br>

Nothing contained on this Website constitutes, and nothing on this Website should be construed as, investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, hold or otherwise transact in any investment including interests in the Funds. It is strongly recommended that you seek professional investment advice before making any investment decision.<br><br>

The information on this Website does not take account of any investor's investment objectives, particular needs or financial situation. Investment in the Funds may not be suitable for you. In addition, nothing on this Website shall, or is intended to, constitute financial, legal, accounting or tax advice. <br><br>

Unless agreed separately in writing with a client, ACME and its affiliates neither provide investment advice to nor receive and transmit orders from investors in the Funds nor do they carry on any other activities with or for such investors that constitute “investment services” or “ancillary services” for the purposes of MiFID. <br><br>

You should consider whether an investment fits your investment objectives, particular needs and financial situation before making any investment decision. You should also inform yourself as to (a) the possible tax consequences, (b) the legal requirements and (c) any foreign exchange restrictions or exchange control requirements which you might encounter under the laws of the countries of your citizenship, residence or domicile and which might be relevant to the subscription, holding, transfer or disposal of interests in the Funds. <br><br>

Any opinion, article, comment, financial analysis, market forecast, market commentary or other such information which is published on this Website is not binding on ACME or its affiliates.</p><br>

<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>7.    Past Performance; Forecast; Simulation: </strong></p>
<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;">To the extent that this Website contains any information regarding the past performance and/or forecast of the Funds, such information is not a reliable indicator of future performance of these Funds and should not be relied upon as a basis for an investment decision. <br><br>

To the extent that this Website contains any information regarding simulated past performance, such information is not a reliable indicator of future performance and should not be relied on as the basis for an investment decision. Investment results for each Fund may vary. <br><br>

The value of investments and the income from them can go down as well as up and investors may not get back the amount originally invested and may lose all of their investment. The value of investments in the Funds may be affected by the price of underlying investments. Exchange rate changes may cause the value of overseas investments to rise or fall.</p><br>

<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>8.    Price Information: </strong></p>
<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;">All prices or values may not reflect actual prices or values that would be available in the market at the time provided or at the time you may decide to purchase or sell an interest in a particular Fund.</p><br>

<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>9.    Risk Warnings: </strong></p>
<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;">There are significant risks associated with an investment in any of the Funds. Investment in the Funds is intended only for those investors who can accept the risks associated with such an investment (including the risk of a complete loss of investment). You should ensure that you have fully understood such risks before taking any decision to invest.<br><br>

These Terms do not represent a complete statement of the risk factors associated with an investment in the Funds. The offering documents for each Fund contain risk warnings which are specific to the relevant Fund. You should consider these risk warnings carefully and take appropriate investment advice before taking any decision to invest.</p><br>

<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>10. Offering Documents: </strong></p>
<p style="font-size:10px; line-height: normal;">The terms of any investment in a Fund are governed by the documents establishing such terms. An application for interests in any of the Funds should only be made having fully and carefully read the offering documents, which are the relevant prospectus, key investor information document, the latest financial reports and any other offering documents for the relevant Fund which are available on this Website and upon request from the fund representative in your jurisdiction and specified in the prospectus for the relevant Fund. <br><br>

It is your responsibility to use the offering documents and by making an application to invest in a Fund you will represent that you have read the prospectus for the relevant Fund, the appropriate key investor information document for the Fund and any other applicable offering document and will agree to be bound by its contents.</p><br>
